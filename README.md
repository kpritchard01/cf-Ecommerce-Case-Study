# cf-Ecommerce Case Study
Initial data and advanced exploratory analysis of a fictional ecommerce business in order to derive insights and suggest strategies through an interactive dashboard that visually showcases results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

# Objective
The goal of the analysis was to conduct an exploratory visual analysis in Python and find connections between variables that seemed worth exploring. After developing hypothesis, various advanced analytical approaches were used to help test them.

The data was accessed through Kaggle, although the origin of the data source is unknown.
